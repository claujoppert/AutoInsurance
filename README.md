# Auto Insurance Complaints Data Cleaning and Exploring (Python)
1. Data Collection & Preparation:
- Data Sources: Gather data from sources such as complaint records from government databases (like the National Association of Insurance Commissioners - NAIC), customer feedback surveys, or internal company complaints.
- Data Cleaning: Ensure the data is free from errors, duplicates, or inconsistencies. Address missing values, correct mislabeled data, and ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- Variable Definition: Understand the key variables, which might include complaint type (claims, pricing, customer service), resolution status (resolved, unresolved), the time taken to resolve complaints, and customer demographics.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Descriptive Statistics: Start by analyzing basic statistics for each feature, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution of variables like complaint type and resolution time.
- Visualization: Use tools like Tableau, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to generate visualizations. Common visualizations include:
     - Bar charts for top 5 companies with most complaints.
     - Line charts to compare companies over time
     - Descriptive statistic tables 
- **Identify Patterns:** Look for trends or total number of complaints throughout the years
