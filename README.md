# Auto Insurance Complaints Data Cleaning and Exploring (Python)
1. Data Loading & Cleaning:
Import the dataset and clean it by checking for missing values or duplicates.
Ensure the data includes relevant columns like Company, Year, Complaint Type, and Complaint Resolution.
2. Identify Top 5 Companies with Most Complaints:
Group the data by Company and count the number of complaints each company has received.
Sort these counts in descending order to identify the top 5 companies.
3. Trend Over Time:
Group the data by Company and Year, and sum the complaints for each year.
Plot a line chart showing the trend of complaints for these top 5 companies over the years. This will reveal if certain companies have seen increasing or decreasing complaints over time.
4. Complaint Types for Top 5 Companies:
For each of the top 5 companies, break down the complaints by Complaint Type (e.g., pricing, claims, customer service).
Visualize this breakdown using stacked bar charts or pie charts to see which types of complaints are most prevalent.
